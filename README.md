# Evolutionary Algorithms

## Objectives

   This repository contains two implementations of evolutionary algorithms, also known as genetic algorithms (GAs), in c. The programs developed were:
  - __target string searcher__;
  
   > The GA tries to guess the target string set by the user.
  
  - __maximum value calculator__.
  
   > The evolutionary algorithm searches for the maximum point of an one variable function.
  
  Essentially, an evolutionary algorithm consists of three steps (selection, crossover and mutation) wich are repeated until termination. Both of the programs mentioned above were implemented considering three different selection methods:
  - roulette wheel selection;
  - tournament selection;
  - elitism ("best mates").  
  
  Also, static and dinamic mutation rates were used, as well as predation techniques.
  
  The programs' description and detailment can be found in their repective folders.
