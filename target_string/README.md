# Overview

The __target string searcher__ evolutionary algorithm tries to guess a user set string starting from a randomly generated string.   
It prints on the terminal the best guess per generation, and the other outputs consist on text files that list the fittest individual score per generation, the avarage fitness per generation and the number of generations needed to find the target string.   
An individual's score is based on the number of letters that differ from the target string, therefore, the optimum score is 0.

The terminal output shows nicely the evolution of the program and looks like the following:

  > Generation:  0	Fittest individual: /C#z_e;un9m%f&LgsJf_/E%
  >
  > Generation: 50	Fittest individual: brP@WtiHlk AjT;gvTitZ@S
  >
  > Generation: 100	Fittest individual: bvop=tiHuk AvAlgorith@S
  >
  > Generation: 200	Fittest individual: Evolutio0SrAvAlgorithms
  >
  > Generation: 250	Fittest individual: Evolutio0arA Algorithms
  >
  > Generation: 300	Fittest individual: Evolutio0arA Algorithms
  >
  > Generation: 350	Fittest individual: Evolutio0arA Algorithms
  >
  > Generation: 400	Fittest individual: Evolutio0ary Algorithms
  >
  > Generation: 450	Fittest individual: Evolutio0ary Algorithms
  >
  > Generation: 490	Fittest individual: Evolutio0ary Algorithms
  
 This algorithm was implemented for three different selection methods:
 - roulette wheel selection;
 - tournament selection;
 - elitism;   
 
 and uses a static mutation rate, each child chromosome gene has a 10% chance of mutating (in this context mutation is the   insertion of a random character).
 
 ### Compiling
 - elitism
```
    g++ -Wall elitism.cpp -o elitism.exe
    ./elitism.exe
```
 - tournamet
```
    g++ -Wall tournament.cpp -o tournament.exe
    ./tournament.exe
```
 - roulette
```
    g++ -Wall roulette.cpp -o roulette.exe
    ./roulette.exe
```
In order to compile the program there are no requirements other than having a gcc compiler installed.
 
 # Elitism
 
 In the elitism method, the fittest 10% of the population is cloned into the new generation, then the rest of the offspring is generated by crossing individuals that belong to fittest 50% of the population.  
 This method priorizes convergence over diversity, and the average score curve is very close to the fittest individual's score curve, as can be seen in the graph bellow, plotted from the data contained in the generated text files.
 The blue dashed line corresponds to the averge score, and the continuous line to the fittest individuals.

  Notice that the closer the algorithm gets to the target string the harder it is to evolve, which results in a behavior similar to f(x) = e<sup>-x</sup> .

# Roulette

  As implemented, the roulette method consists in a fitness proportionate selection in which the fitter an individual is, the greater probability it has of being chosen as a parent.   
  Likewise, the graph bellow was plotted from the data output. The blue dashed line corresponds to the averge score, and the continuous line to the fittest individual's score.

# Tournament

  In short, the tournament selection method consists in, for each of the two potential parents, choosing N random individuals.   
  These individuals then "compete" and the fitter shall be one of the parents to the child chromosome. This program implements the tournament of two (N = 2). 
  
  The graphs plotted show that for this particular application the tournament method exhibits a slow convergence while the diversity is preserved, since the avarage score curve doesn't aproach significantly the fittest individuals curve.
